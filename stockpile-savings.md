Stockpile Savings [(app website link)](https://taylor-young0.github.io/Stockpile/) is an iOS app I made during summer 2020. The project was started at the end of May and published on the App Store on June 30th.

### Project Planning

Stockpile Savings started out from a simple idea -- you can save money by stocking up on your cyclical
purchases when they are on sale. This lead me to believe that one of the best ways
to prove this was to make an app that not only stores your lifetime savings, but also
helps *maximize* your savings.

Initial interface planning was done in my notebook. The two
individual screens were sketched out to provide a general idea of how the
content could be spaced out effectively.

### UI Prototypes

UI prototypes were then completed using the [iOS 13 UI elements Keynote project](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/)
from the Apple Design Resources.
